# E-Commerce-Book-Store
Book Selling Website

I created this website with html,css,javascript,Php... And for database i use MYSQL and for host the website i use localhost by wampserver you can use xampp server as well.. or any other localhost server.. and in IDE i use VISUAL STUDIO CODE(VS Code)....
Before you run the code you have to create a MYSQL database where you have to create DATABASE NAME AND TABLE NAME and inside the table name you have to add the columns accordingly and make changes in the php files...
and the check for all the files are sync properly.. then you code will run.. without an issue...

Thank You........
